# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
## Project Objective
I created a sales dashboard in Power BI to analyze data, involving several key stages such as data processing, data cleaning, and data visualization.

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the total sales revenue& profit?
- How many total orders were placed?
- Which year had the highest sales volume?
- What trend do you observe in sales and orders from 2019 to 2021?
- Who was the top-performing salesperson in terms of sales amount?
- How does each salesperson's performance compare in terms of orders and revenue?
- Which three products had sales over $2M?
- What is the profit contribution of each product group?
